## Game Design Document
- This serves as a guiding light in all my trials and tribulations as I try to make a working clone of Pong in C using SDL2. I am intentionally keeping the scope very small in able to get a working project (real world application of curriculum) under my belt. I will try to take creative liberties where possible and as time allows. I am aiming to get this done within about ~3 weeks. The aim is sort of a "cozy pong", to make it a little bit unique. We will see how it goes.
